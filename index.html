					Even when the final deliverable is a pattern library, clients often still expect to sign off on page designs. As pages make their way through various teams and managers for approval, they are, of course, discussed; before you know it, they turn into Home page, Listing page, Product page, and so on.
					Everyone is thinking in terms of pages, so it can seem natural for component design and page design to occur in tandem. But building components from page designs is like starting from the outside and working in—and that can get complicated.
					At Clearleft, the challenge of simultaneously developing pages and components became particularly evident in some of our recent projects, where instead of delivering completed pattern libraries to our clients,
					we were asked to collaborate with in-house teams of designers and developers to help them build and maintain their own. In one instance, as an exercise, we spent a few weeks focusing on UX and UI with a team before we asked them to name and code components from the designs.
					We were working from a product page design with product-related content in each component. The first component we built looked like a card, so everyone called it “product card.” We continued the exercise for different components, with similar results.
					Now, it’s great that people came up with unanimous suggestions—but do you see a problem with this naming structure? What if the component moves to another page or gets populated with different content? You could also think of the product card as a “profile card” or a “location card.
					” It might be reused for a range of different purposes. The name “card” would be simpler and far more versatile.
